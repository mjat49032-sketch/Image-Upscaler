3. Settings → Pages → Branch: `main` → Folder: `/` → Save.
4. Wait ~30–60 seconds and open https://username.github.io

## Adding Ads (quick options)
- For long-term stability use **Google AdSense**:
  1. Sign up at https://www.google.com/adsense
  2. Create site and add the provided script to the `<head>` of each page replacing the AD placeholder.
  3. AdSense approval can take a few days.

- For fast approval (start earning quickly) use **PropellerAds** or **Adsterra**:
  1. Sign up at PropellerAds/Adsterra and create a site entry.
  2. They give you a JS snippet — paste it where the AD placeholder is.
  3. These networks approve faster for small sites and can start showing ads in hours.

## Important - Replace placeholders
- Replace `ad-slot` comment boxes with your ad network script.
- Replace affiliate `href="#"` with your affiliate URLs.

## SEO & Growth tips (quick)
- Add meta description and Open Graph tags.
- Submit sitemap to Google Search Console (very important).
- Publish 1 article per week and keep the tools list growing.
- Share on Reddit/Telegram/WhatsApp groups for initial traffic.
